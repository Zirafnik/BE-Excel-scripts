# BE-Excel-script

This is a script for manipulating excel table data, for a research project in my Business Environment class.

None of the available solutions easily solved the issues of deleting and interacting with only specific cells, so I created this program.

## removeNegVal.js
Removes negative values from table. Negative values represent skipped questions or dropping out of survey. Removing them is cruicial, as the correlation would be strong between questions where if you did not answer a question, the likelihood of not answering consequent questions is high.

## brandCounter.js
Counts number of mentions for each specific company. Also counts number of people that were familiar with at least one company.
